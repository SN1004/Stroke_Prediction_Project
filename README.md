Project under guidance of Dr.Nagarajan Ganapathy

Published Paper - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373119177_Stroke_prediction_using_different_approaches

Dataset used for this paper was from Kaggle.com

Link to dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

1. Start by creating a new virtual enviroment

1. Using requirements.txt install all the required dependencies

2. Download tabular dataset for stroke binary classification

3. Before running change the "data_path" to your dataset location

4. Start by running jupyter notebook of any of the approaches that you would like to check

4. (Optional, if other dataset used) The preprocessing was done in notebook for linked dataset, so be sure to explore your dataset using those methods before feeding to models

5. (Optional, if other dataset used) Check the numbers of features of your dataset and pass(if any) features which cannot be classified as binary or in different classes using positional values through one-hot encoding

6. (Optional, if other dataset used) Replace original "input_shape" in first layer of each approach's model with your dataset features obtained after one-hot encoding

7. After completing above steps, you can run all the below cells and see the results for each approaches
