# Stroke_Prediction_Project

Project for course BM5020 (AI in Biomedical and Healthcare) under Professor Nagarajan Ganapathy.

In this project, I have developed model to predict if the person has chances to have stroke using variables such as gender, age, marital status, smoking status, bmi, glucose levels, work type, type of residencial area, hypertension, heart disease.

Dataset used is from Kaggle.com
